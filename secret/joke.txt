An undercover agent was sent to an Irish village
and told to make contact with their local man
called O’Reilly who knew the code phrase
"The birds will be flying high tomorrow."

He asked someone in the street where he could
find Mr O’Reilly and got the answer "Well,
there’s O’Reilly the butcher, O’Reilly the
postman and sure my own name is O’Reilly."

The agent decided to take a risk and said:
"The birds will be flying high tomorrow."

"Oh! It’s O’Reilly the spy you’re wanting!
He’ll be down in the pub."
